- Decide to introspect into data further and find out dataset is imbalanced again, so apply changes to code
- Learn about balanced label distribution in a batch and decide to acheive it, also realise the other distributions of gender and race must be balanced as well
- Each race and gender has a different rate of ageing which will impact age (correlation)
- Make code to undersample and acheive perfect data distribution in classes 3 and 4 but count is too less
- Acheived perfect data distribution in 0,3,4 and all classes results are [240, 136, 120, 776, 1808], for context the original class counts are [1568,616,769,1777,4234]

- Achieved 49% train and test macrof1 performance which is the highest so far, but how do i improve it ? There is very less data for some cases as well
- Out of curiosity i checked the individual f1 scores and 4 out of 5 classes were not predicted ?? something is very wrong
- I tried changed the metric from Macrof1 to aucroc and im getting errors something is fundamentally broken in my model code

- A tiny mistake in my generator class which failed to account samples < batchsize
- Model performs very badly, with 20% macrof1, need more data

- Read about StyleGAN, Cgan, indefinite break
